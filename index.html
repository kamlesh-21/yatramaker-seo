    <h2>How YatraMaker Works</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike traditional travel websites that start with destinations, YatraMaker starts with your
      <strong>budget</strong>. You tell us how much you want to spend, and we help you discover
      destinations, itineraries, and holidays that fit comfortably within that budget.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach reduces uncertainty, overspending, and decision fatigue. It is ideal for families,
      couples, solo travellers, and anyone planning travel in India with a fixed or flexible budget.
